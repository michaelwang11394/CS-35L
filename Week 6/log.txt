Instal Ubantu onto Viritual Machine

To install SSH, I ran the following commands in Open SSH:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	sudo apt-get install openssh-client

As the server:

To make the public and private keys:
	ssh-keygen

Create an account for the client:
	sudo useradd -d /home/newuser -m new user
	sudo passwd newuser
	password=password

Create .ssh directory for the partner
	cd/home/newuser
	sudo mkdir .ssh

To change ownership and permission on .ssh directory
	sudo chown -R newuser .ssh
	sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Use ifconfig to check the server IP address

To see if server is working properly:
	ps aux | grep ssh

Partner can now ssh my server.

Ass the client:

To make the public and and private keys
	ssh-keygen

To copy the public key to the server for my key-based authentication
	ssh-copy-id -i <userName>@<serverIPAddress>

To add the private key to authentication agent:
	ssh-add 
	password

SSH to the server:
	ssh <username>@<serverIPAddress>

To try out the x-session forwarding: 
	ssh -X <userName>@<serverIPAddress>
The GUI is successfully shown!
