2. 
- create and switch to new branch off of quote
git checkout v3.0
- go to v3.0 on the new branch

6. git add .
git commit --file=ChangeLog
git commit --amend --author='Michael Wang <michaelwang888@ucla.edu>'


7. git log 
- to make sure that the log worked
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. git checkout -b partner v3.0
git am formatted-patch.txt

*NOTE*:
******I had to diff and run a file with someone who previously took the class due to the fact that I was not assigned a partner and I was running out of time to find one. No one was responding to my requests. My fault for starting the project late, but I figured that everyone's patch should be the same. *****

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

9. make distdir

10. open lnxsrv on Remote Desktop
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
