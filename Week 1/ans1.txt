1)How can you get man to print all the commands that have a specific word in their man page (or at least the description part of the man page)? (hint: man man)

man man
man -k <word>

2)Where are the cp and wc programs located in the file system?

whereis cp:/usr/bin/cp /usr/local/cs/bin/cp /usr/share/man/man1p/cp.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/cp.1.gz
whereis wc:/usr/bin/wc /usr/local/cs/bin/wc /usr/share/man/man1p/wc.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/wc.1.gz

3)

w: shows who is logged on and what they are doing
X: a portable network-transparent window system
[: check file types and compare values
  
 cd usr/bin
   ls 
   Scroll to find 1 character executables 
   whatis [
   whatis w
   whatis Xqqc

4) When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, which file actually is executed?

gcc

cd /usr/bin
   find cc
   readlink cc

5)The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic mode g+s,o-x mean, in terms of permissions?


You can set or clear bits with symbolic modes and you can set bits with numeric mode, so essentially you're taking away permissions of a file.

man chmod
   /g-s

6)What option to find lets you search for files that have been modified in the last three weeks?

find -mtime -21

man find
   scroll and read
   find -mtime -21

7) Use the previous answer to find all directories modified in the last three weeks.

etc.... really long list

find / -mtime -21

8)Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic links?

287

   whereis find
   cd /bin
   find -type l
   find -type l | wc -l

9)What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib directory?

drwxr-xr-x.  6 root root    4096 Sep 29  2014 kbd

cd /usr/lib
   man lsq
   ls -l -a -t -rq  q
10) Where does the locale command get its data from?

		When  locale  is  invoked without any arguments, it shall summarize the
       current locale environment for each locale category  as  determined  by
       the  settings  of the environment variables defined in the Base Defini‚Äê
       tions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7, Locale.

       When invoked with operands,  it  shall  write  values  that  have  been
       assigned to the keywords in the locale categories, as follows:

        * Specifying  a  keyword  name  shall select the named keyword and the
          category containing that keyword.

        * Specifying a category name shall select the named category  and  all
          keywords in that category.

man locale

12)Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-a through C-M-h do? Can you list their actions concisely?

C-M-a
C-M-h

C-M-a: Move to beginning of current or preceding defun (beginning-of-defun).
C-M-h: Put region around whole current or following defun (mark-defun).

15)When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command, and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command?

You can use dire to open up the files, while -l just lets you view them

C-x d
